<!--
This is a div (block element) with no width set. It defaults to 100%. I set a
height becuase without a height or something inside of the div, you could not
see the div because it would default to 0.
-->
    <span>Default</span>
    <div class="default"></div>
    <br />


<!--
This shows a parent child relationship. The parent is on the outside and the child
is what is on the inside. An element can only have one parent or child, however that
parent or child can have it's own parent.

Because block elements are 100% width by default, I made the child smaller. Otherwise
the child would take up the entire width of the parent div.
-->
    <span>Parent/Child</span>
    <div class="default"><!-- Parent -->
        <div class="red"></div><!-- Child-->
    </div>
    <br />

    <div class="default"><!-- Parent -->
        <div class="red"><!-- Child of default and parent of green -->
            <div class="green"></div><!-- Child of red -->
        </div>
    </div>
    <br />


<!--
In this last example, notice how block elements automatically get put on a new line. The
purple is placed under the green. Block elments always take a new line unless you tell
them not to with CSS.
-->
    <div class="default"><!-- Parent -->
        <div class="red"><!-- Child of default and parent of green -->
            <div class="green"></div><!-- Child of red and sibling to purple-->
            <div class="purple"></div><!-- Child of red and sibling to green-->
        </div>
    </div>
    <br />


<!--
Here I have set the child div's width to 50%. What is important here is 50% of what? 50% of
it's parent.
-->
    <span>Width and Percentage</span>
    <div class="default"><!-- Parent -->
        <div class="orange"></div><!-- Child-->
    </div>
    <br />


<!--
Now in this example, I'm changing the width of the parent to 500px. The child adjusts on it's
own. It is still 50% of it's parent. Since the parent has a set with of 500px, that means that
orange must be 250px;
-->
<div class="default-smaller-width"><!-- Parent -->
    <div class="orange"></div><!-- Child-->
</div>
